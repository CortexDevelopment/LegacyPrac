# Array 2.0

Just open sourcing this abandoned project. Some code is just gay, and some is decently re-usable. Do whatever you want with it,
just add the credits provided below. As for anyone actually trying to use this, it's quite broken in places and has bugs, last I remember is
reworking the menus, so that's a bit of information to help if you are working on it.
